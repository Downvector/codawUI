<p>Heroes of the storm: tab-score screen has enough categories that you fille like you're among the top3 in one category (frog-pond effect)

<li>Treating data
<ul><li><p>I developed the feedback-logger method, because: long treatment time causes problem, not in sync with the dev team's current focus
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presenting results
<ul><li><p>Not just another opinion, but instead say those results come from scientific approach (unemotional, I am emotionally detached from my results)
<p>Not trying to override the game designers' work, just suggestion based on things like Gestalt law

<li><span style="font-family: SansSerif, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Interacting with game teams</span>
<ul><li><p>explaining UX: my job is to make sure players interact with the game as you the game designer intended
<p>Bringing results EARLY has more value than being scientifically correct
<p>Being embedded within dev teams
<p>We do not make games easier: example of 
<p>Building trust before trying to impose your process: first explain that together we are going to save time and money
</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="font-family: SansSerif, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Career: what I want to do</span>
<ul><li><p>living in the US
<p>work on different types of projects: games, game engines, websites
<p>UX is an umbrella term, I identify myself as an interaction-designer and a user-researcher
<p>being a specialist in a big company/publisher: being expert at something on project with very tight schedule, finally finding a solution for the team
<p>Not a senior: less good at generating new ideas but strong at implementing a detailed solution. I still want to work under someone's direction for a while. I knew at Ankama that their offer came too early
<p>Ankama: wanted to work on multiple projects at once, embedded within teams
<ul><li><p>I was recruited after making my portfolio webside dedicated to them and the position, how I could fit
<p>I left because I felt not competent enough for the job offered
</li>
</ul><p>Crytek: wanted to work on both games and engine, both design and user-testing
<ul><li><p>I was noticed through twitter by the lead UX designer and offered a job 
<p>I left because the project got killed and they told me that no team work would come for the next 6 months
</li>
</ul><p>Ubisoft: wanted to see how my skills compared with some of the best in the field
<ul><li><p>I asked a friend whom I worked with at school, he told his lead that I could fit the role
<p>I have been away from development teams for too long. And the HQ structure does not allow me to help dev teams enough
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-family: SansSerif, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">My questions</span>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: SansSerif, sans-serif; ">is it a new, or existing position? if new, are the responsabilities new or taken from other people?</span>

</li>
<li>What are epic's plans regarding the UX team? Will it grow by several employees soon?

</li>
<li>Where in the floorplan is located the UX team? all in the same place?

</li>
<li>What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 60 to 90 days?

</li>
<li>who would be my manager, what is his management style? (frequent feedback vs no feedback)

</li>
<li>What type of persons tend to succeed in this company? What type fail?
